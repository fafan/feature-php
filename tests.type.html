<h2 id="acceptance-testing">Acceptance Testing</h2>
<p>Acceptance testing is a formal type of software testing that is performed by end user when the features have been delivered by developers. The aim of this testing is to check if the software confirms to their business needs and to the requirements provided earlier. Acceptance tests are normally documented at the beginning of the sprint (in agile) and is a means for testers and developers to work towards a common understanding and shared business domain knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility-testing">Compatibility testing</h2>
<p>Compatibility testing is one of the test types performed by the testing team. Compatibility testing checks if the software can be run on different hardware, operating system, bandwidth, databases, web servers, application servers, hardware peripherals, emulators, different configuration, processor, different browsers and different versions of the browsers etc.,</p>
<h2 id="integration-testing">Integration Testing</h2>
<p>Integration testing is one of the most common and important types of software testing. Once the individual units or components are tested by developers as working then testing team will run tests that will test the connectivity among these units/component or multiple units/components. There are different approaches for Integration testing namely, Top-down integration testing, Bottom-up integration testing and a combination of these two known as Sand witch testing.</p>
<h2 id="interface-testing">Interface Testing</h2>
<p>Interface Testing is needed when a software provides support for one or more interfaces like “Graphical user interface”, “Command Line Interface” or “Application programming interface” to interact with its users or other software. Interfaces serve as the medium for software to accept input from a user and provide an output to the user. Approach for interface testing depends on the type of the interface being testing like GUI or API or CLI.</p>
<h3 id="api-testing">API Testing</h3>
<p>API testing is a type of testing that is similar to unit testing. Each of the Software APIs are tested as per API specification. API testing is mostly done by testing team unless APIs to be tested or complex and needs extensive coding. API testing requires understanding both API functionality and possessing good coding skills.</p>
<h3 id="gui-graphical-user-interface-testing">GUI (Graphical User Interface) testing</h3>
<p>This type of software testing is aimed at testing the software GUI (Graphical User Interface) of the software meets the requirements as mentioned in the GUI mockups and Detailed designed documents. For e.g. checking the length and capacity of the input fields provided on the form, type of input field provided, e.g. some of the form fields can be displayed as drop-down box or a set of radio buttons. So GUI testing ensures GUI elements of the software are as per approved GUI mockups, detailed design documents, and functional requirements. Most of the functional test automation tools work on GUI capture and playback capabilities. This makes script recording faster at the same time increases the effort on script maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="black-box-testing">Black Box testing</h2>
<p>Black box testing is a software testing method where testers are not required to know coding or internal structure of the software. Black box testing method relies on testing software with various inputs and validating results against expected output.</p>
<p>In Black Box Testing, the tester tests an application without knowledge of the internal workings of the application being tested. Data are entered into the application and the outcome is compared with the expected results; what the program does with the input data or how the program arrives at the output data is not a concern for the tester performing black box testing. All that is tested is the behavior of the functions being tested.</p>
<p>This is why black box testing is also known as functional testing which tests the functionality of a program. Note we can also have non-functional black box testing, such as performance testing which is a type of black box testing but instead of verifying the behavior of the system, it tests how long it takes for a function to respond to user’s inputs and how long it takes to process the data and generate outputs.</p>
<h3 id="functional-testing">Functional Testing</h3>
<p>Functional testing is a formal type of testing performed by testers. Functional testing focuses on testing software against design document, Use cases, and requirements document.</p>
<h3 id="performance-testing">Performance Testing</h3>
<p>is a type of software testing and part of performance engineering that is performed to check some of the quality attributes of software like Stability, reliability, availability. Performance testing is carried out by performance engineering team. Unlike Functional testing, Performance testing is done to check non-functional requirements. Performance testing checks how well the software works in anticipated and peak workloads. There are different variations or sub types of performance like load testing, stress testing, volume testing, soak testing and configuration testing.</p>
<h2 id="white-box-testing">White Box testing</h2>
<p>White box testing strategy deals with the internal logic and structure of the code. White box testing is also called as glass, structural, open box or clear box testing. The tests written based on the white box testing strategy incorporate coverage of the code written, branches, paths, statements and internal logic of the code etc.</p>
<p>In order to implement white box testing, the tester has to deal with the code and hence is needed to possess knowledge of coding and logic i.e. internal working of the code. White box test also needs the tester to look into the code and find out which unit/statement/chunk of the code is malfunctioning.</p>
<h2 id="unit-testing">Unit Testing</h2>
<p>The developer carries out unit testing in order to check if the particular module or unit of code is working fine. The Unit Testing comes at the very basic level as it is carried out as and when the unit of the code is developed or a particular functionality is built.</p>
<h2 id="statement-coverage">Statement Coverage</h2>
<p>In this type of testing the code is executed in such a manner that every statement of the application is executed at least once. It helps in assuring that all the statements execute without any side effect.</p>
<h2 id="branch-coverage">Branch Coverage</h2>
<p>No software application can be written in a continuous mode of coding, at some point we need to branch out the code in order to perform a particular functionality. Branch coverage testing helps in validating of all the branches in the code and making sure that no branching leads to abnormal behavior of the application.</p>
<h2 id="security-testing">Security Testing</h2>
<p>Security Testing is carried out in order to find out how well the system can protect itself from unauthorized access, hacking – cracking, any code damage etc. which deals with the code of application. This type of testing needs sophisticated testing techniques.</p>
<h2 id="penetration-testing">Penetration Testing</h2>
<p>is a type of security testing. Penetration testing is done to tests how secure software and its environments (Hardware, Operating system, and network) are when subject to attack by an external or internal intruder. An intruder can be a human/hacker or malicious programs. Pentest uses methods to forcibly intrude (by brute force attack) or by using a weakness (vulnerability) to gain access to a software or data or hardware with an intent to expose ways to steal, manipulate or corrupt data, software files or configuration. Penetration Testing is a way of ethical hacking, an experienced Penetration tester will use the same methods and tools that a hacker would use but the intention of Penetration tester is to identify vulnerability and get them fixed before a real hacker or malicious program exploits it.</p>
